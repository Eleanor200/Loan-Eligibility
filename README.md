# Loan Eligibility Prediction System
## Project Overview
The Loan Eligibility Prediction System is an application designed to predict the likelihood of an individual being eligible for a loan based on various financial and personal factors. This system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict loan eligibility, thereby assisting financial institutions in decision-making and potential borrowers in understanding their chances of loan approval.

## Features
Predictive Modeling: Utilizes a trained machine learning model to predict loan eligibility.
User-Friendly Interface: A Streamlit-based web interface that allows users to input their details and receive instant predictions.
Insightful Feedback: Provides users with insights into factors that may influence their loan eligibility.

## Installation
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-repository/Loan-Eligibility-Prediction.git
cd Loan-Eligibility-Prediction

2. Set up a Python Environment (Optional but recommended)

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Application

streamlit run app.py

## Usage
Once the application is running, navigate to the provided URL (typically http://localhost:8501). Enter the required information in the input fields and click the "Check Eligibility" button to receive a prediction.

## Model Training
Details about the model training process, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

1. Data Preprocessing: Describe how the data was cleaned, encoded, and preprocessed.
2. Feature Engineering: Outline any derived features used.
3. Model Selection: Discuss why certain models were chosen.
4. Model Evaluation: Provide insights into the performance metrics.

## Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language used.
Streamlit: For creating the web application.
Pandas: For data manipulation.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning model development.
Joblib: For model serialization.
